============================================
PyXMPP2 – Python Jabber/XMPP implementation
============================================

Introduction
------------

The goal of this project is to rewrite PyXMPP so:

- it doesn't rely on libxml2 any more
- it uses most current Python APIs
- its API is cleaned up
- etc.

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.7 or 3.2
- `DNSPython`_  Limited functionality is available without it.

.. _DNSPython: http://www.dnspython.org/

Python 3 support
----------------

The source code is written for Python 2.7, but automated facilities are
available for conversion to 3.2. For this to work you need the `Distribute`_
package installed for Python 3.

.. _Distribute: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute

To build or install the py3k package run the ``setup.py`` script using the
Python 3 interpreter::

    python3 setup.py build
    python3 setup.py install

You may want to give ``--build-base py3-build`` option to build if you are
also building Python 2 version.

If you have the GNU Make utility (every Linux distribution provides it) you
may use ``make`` command instead::

    make py3-build
    make py3-install

Those will also make the Python3 version of the examples in the py3-examples
directory if you are using a GIT checkout (source distributions already
provide those).

As for now (2011-07-02) there is no official `DNSPython`_ release for
Python 3, you may want to check their `experimental branch`_.

Features
--------

- `RFC 6120`_ – XMPP Core:

  - SRV record look-up (requires `DNSPython`_)

  - XML streams:

    - both initiator and receiver side
    - 'xml:lang' attribute handling on the root element
    - 'version' attribute handling, including special '0.9' (no version) case
    - full XML namespace support
    - does not generate and does not accept XML that is not well-formed
    - stream errors

  - StartTLS:
   
    - initiator (client) side implemented
    - cerificate verification:

      - 'Subject Alt Name' / 'DNS' field
      - 'Subject' / 'Common Name' field

  - SASL:

    - both initiator and receiver side
    - supported mechanisms:

      - PLAIN
      - DIGEST-MD5

  - Resource binding

  - XMPP Stanzas:

    - ``<iq/>``, ``<presence/>`` and ``<message/>`` stanzas
    - stanza errors

- `RFC 6121`_ – XMPP Instant Messaging and Presence:

  - Roster Management:

    - versioned rosters
    - subscription pre-approval flag

- `RFC 6122`_ – XMPP Address Format:

  - Full unicode support
  - 'Nameprep' strinprep profile for the local part (for validation and
    comparision)
  - 'Resourceprep' for the resource part
  - 'IDNA' encoding for the domain part

- XMPP Extensions:

  - `XEP-0092`_ – Software Version

- I/O framework:

  - asynchronous main event loop
  - alternative implementation with threads
  - non-blocking connect
  - non-blocking TLS handshake

- stanza processing framework:

  - chained handlers for ``<message/>`` and ``<presence/>`` stanzas,
    matched by stanza type and, optionally, payload class (derivied from
    namespace-qualified element name)

  - handlers for ``<iq type='get'/>`` and ``<iq type='set'/>`` stanzas,
    matched by payload element name (namespace-qualified)

  - handlers for ``<iq type='result'/>`` and ``<iq type='error'/>``
    registered for outbound ``<iq type='get'/>`` and ``<iq type='set'/>``
    stanzas and matched by the stanza id
